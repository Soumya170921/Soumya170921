# hey there 👋 i’m Soumya Kumari

✨ frontend fangirl | 🧩 mern stack explorer | 🎨 designing stuff that actually looks good

welcome to my little dev corner on GitHub where I build ✨vibe-heavy✨ projects, fight bugs like a boss, and turn coffee into code ☕💻

---

### ⚙️ what i build with
- 🎯 **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Tailwind (aka my aesthetic toolkit)
- 🔙 **Backend**: Node.js, Express, MongoDB, MySQL (yes, I do both sides 😎)


---

### 🚀 some of my fav builds
- 🛒 **E-Commerce Platform** – full-stack vibes w/ Stripe checkout + admin control
- 💬 **Social Media Dashboard** – real-time chats, Redis notifs, the whole package

---

### 🛠️ currently cooking
- 🧠 an AI-powered LMS that recommends courses like Netflix recommends drama


---

### 🧬 forever learning
- TypeScript (typing is cool now)
- Next.js (for that SSR energy)
- Docker & CI/CD (because deployment shouldn’t be scary)
- AI + Web fusion (chatbots are the new besties)
